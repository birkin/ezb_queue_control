To do...

Wouldn't it be cool to run a vagrant provision script that would:
- install Ubuntu
- install redis and db and sendmail
- install a virtualenv
- install this code
- pip install dependencies into the virtual env
- fire up redis

Then, another script run manually would:
- ensure a job-queue and 2 workers were set up
- dump a dozen requests into the db that the workers would start processing

...and the callers would hit mock-apis that randomly returned found/not-found data for the controller to handle,
sending you User and Admin emails.
